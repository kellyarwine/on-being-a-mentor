# On Being a Mentor #

## You are not a teacher ##

An apprenticeship is a guided learning experience, not merely an instructional
classroom. There will certainly be times for teaching, but the ultimate goal is
to graduate a life-long learner. The apprentice must become self-directed.

Your primary role is that of a mentor. You come alongside the apprentice. You
show them by example what being a crafter is. You ask guiding questions and
help the apprentice.

## Hikers in the woods ##

An apprenticeship is like two hikers in the woods.

Imagine you are hiking down a forested trail with your apprentice. Imagine
yourself walking beside the apprentice, not out in front. All of a sudden, you
stop. Your apprentice stops with you. You both stand in silence. The apprentice
is confused, wondering why you've stopped. Then all of a sudden, a deer crashes
out of the forest, onto the trail right in front of you, then scurries off in the
other direction.

After the deer is gone, you explain to your apprentice what you saw and heard
that alerted you to the deer's presence. You show the footprints, the scat, and
encourage the apprentice to keep an eye out.

Next, imagine you come to a fork in the trail. You are familiar with these
woods, you know that one trail leads you back home, and the other adds 5 miles
to your trip. A teacher would pull out a map, show the apprentice your current
location, and show which trail to take. But you are not a teacher, you are a
mentor. Instead, you ask the apprentice to decide. "Which way should we go?"
Then, if the apprentice asks for a map, you provide the map. If the apprentice
takes off down the longer path, you continue to walk alongside them.

Imagine your apprentice chose the long way. When you manage to get where you
are going, you raise the question. "I wonder where that other path went." Then
you might pull out the map and show the apprentice how to read it. Not only
will the apprentice have gained some knowledge, but they also have 5 extra miles
of weariness to where the lesson "Check your map at every crossroads" really sets
in.

Through the entire day's hike, you've kept the apprentice safe. You've always
known exactly where you were and how to get back home. At any moment, you could
taken charge and avoid any danger.

## Sacred responsibility ##

Mentoring another is not a task to take lightly. Another person is trusting you
to show them the right things and to help them start a journey that will affect
the rest of their career. To have another person trusting you in that way and
depending on you that much is no ordinary responsibility.

Vocation is the idea of doing the work that one was meant to do. Mentoring an
apprentice is helping that person to find their vocation. It goes a little bit
beyond the responsibilities of a job, because you are in the position to have a
profound effect on the direction of a person's future.

## Many hats ##

As a mentor, you will often need to play many different roles for the benefit
of the apprentice. At times you may wear the hat of a customer, placing
pressure on the apprentice to complete tasks in the committed time frame. At
other times, you may need encourage the apprentice as an athletic coach would.

The key is to deliberately choose the roles you will play. Approach every
interaction asking yourself the questions "What hat do I need to put on?" "What
role can I play to help my apprentice take the next step forward?" Be prepared
to be firm in some situations and gentle in others.

## Giving Effective Feedback ##

### Be specific ###

It is easy to tell someone they did a good job. It makes them happy, and you
feel good for making them happy. It is much more difficult to tell someone they
are doing a bad job. Feelings can be hurt, and intentions can be misread. In
both cases, it is not enough to just say "nice work!" or "you screwed up!"â€”the
most effective feedback is specific.

Consider a code review. Saying the code is good overall may make an apprentice
feel good, but it doesn't help them focus on where they did particularly well.
By calling out specific methods that are well-factored, or pointing to classes
that are well-named, the apprentice gains understanding of what "good" code
actually is, and can replicate it.

On the flip side, saying code is bad isn't helpful on its own. Instead, by
calling out lines of code that are duplicated or untested directly, the
apprentice sees what "bad" code is, and can avoid it the next time.

### Be timely ###

Do not wait to give feedback. The impact of the conversation will be much more
effective when details are fresh, and it will help you avoid holding minor
incidents against an apprentice later.

As a mentor, one of the worst situations you can be in is having a different
opinion of the apprenticeship's progress than that of the apprentice. If things
are not going well, don't wait to tell them until months later. Deliver it now
and save yourself a painful conversation.

### Be relevant ###

Praise or criticize for the right reasons. If your apprentice is doing
something that goes against the principles you are trying to teach, explain why
and reinforce the big picture. If your apprentice is doing very well in one
area but it's not critical for the success of apprenticeship, don't praise too
highly. You can tell them they are doing a great job in that area, but remind
them of the end goal and ask them to focus their efforts there.
